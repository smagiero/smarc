# Intro

`smarc` is a where I prototype RISC-V cores + memory system + accelerators for future **sequencing SoCs** (to handle workloads on molecule chains like DNA, streaming sensors, path planners, etc.). It consists of two main parts.  `smile` checks what the codes does on the core and `smicro` checls how the system moves the data.

## Packages

- **smile** – core model and programs  
  - `Tile1`: a simple RV32 core with a clean `MemoryPort` interface  
  - Tiny test programs and support code for instruction decode/execute
  
- **smicro** – SoC harness and testbenches  
  - Instantiates cores, DRAM, memory controllers, testers  
  - Drives experiments via `./smicro -suite=... -topo=...`


## What can I do here?

- Run protocol and DRAM tests (`-suite=proto_*`, `-suite=hal_*`)
- Let the core run directly against DRAM (`-suite=proto_core`) and watch instruction traces
- Evolve the core and memory system together, while keeping the same high-level driver interface

## When to use `smile` vs `smicro`

**Use `smile` for…**

- Checking what a small RISC-V program actually does to Tile1’s registers and memory
- Stepping instruction-by-instruction with a debugger to debug decode/execute/trap behavior
- Trying out CUSTOM-0 instructions and accelerators and verifying their results

**Use `smicro` for…**

- Testing the MemCtrl ↔ DRAM protocol and timing with scripted traffic
- Running Tile1 inside a small SoC harness to check system-level integration
- Exploring how different memory latencies/topologies affect request/response timing

For more detail, see:

- [smile](./smile.md) – Tile1 core, instruction decode/execute, and how it talks to memory
- [smicro](./smicro.md) – SoC wiring, memory paths, test suites
